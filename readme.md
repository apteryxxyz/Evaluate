**Evaluate** is a suite of tools that lets you run code in any programming language from anywhere, anytime.

It includes:

- A minimal web interface for writing and running code via a simple CodeMirror editor
- A browser extension that can detect and execute code on any webpage
- A Discord bot that executes code through slash commands in chat

Evaluate is designed to be lightweight, accessible, and instantly useful â€” no setup, just run code.
