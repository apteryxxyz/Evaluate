# Evaluate (Discord Bot)

A Discord bot that brings code execution directly into chat. Users can run code in any supported language through simple slash commands, making it easy to test snippets or demonstrate solutions without leaving the server. Built with Carbon and powered by the same engine as the main site, it integrates seamlessly into the Discord experience for quick, contextual code evaluation.
